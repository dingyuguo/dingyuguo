- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dingyuguo
- ðŸ‘€ My current interests mainly focus on the research of basic image processing, video content understanding, multimodal learning
and intelligent decision making etc. As for the research on image processing, I would like to combine scientific research with industry, 
and devote myself to the research of novel methods of computer vision and the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. 
As for the research on intelligent decision making, the main work I want to do is based on the current basic theory of artificial intelligence,
but not limited to the current popular deep learning methods, trying to endow machines with real intelligence. With the improvement of my cognition, 
I am willing to get in touch with new research fields that I am interested in.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning methods,image processing alogrithms and English. Haha.....
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... Email me at dyg1993@foxmail.com.
